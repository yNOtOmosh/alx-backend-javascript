TypeScript knows the JavaScript language and will generate types for you in many cases. For example in creating a variable and assigning it to a particular value, TypeScript will use the value as its type.

let helloWorld = "Hello World";
        
let helloWorld: string
Try
By understanding how JavaScript works, TypeScript can build a type-system that accepts JavaScript code but has types. This offers a type-system without needing to add extra characters to make types explicit in your code. Thatâ€™s how TypeScript knows that helloWorld is a string in the above example.
